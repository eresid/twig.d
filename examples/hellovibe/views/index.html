        <h1>Welcome in "The Venus Project" Page, {{ username }}</h1>

        <p>The Venus Project proposes an alternative vision of what the future can be if we apply what we already know in order
            to achieve a sustainable new world civilization.</p>
        <p>It calls for a straightforward redesign of our culture in which the age-old inadequacies of war, poverty, hunger,
            debt and unnecessary human suffering are viewed not only as avoidable, but as totally unacceptable.</p>
        <p>Anything less will result in a continuation of the same catalog of problems inherent in today's world.</p>
